# Computer-Systems-And-Networks
Serious Labs

## Lab №1 task:
*Create a program that scans the local network and display information about the nodes in it. For each node, the program must display the MAC address and name. The program should also display the MAC address and the name of its own computer where the program is running.*
## Recommendations:
* *To provide for work in a situation when several network interfaces are active and the computer is connected to several networks simultaneously.*
* *If the search for addresses of the local network is performed, then retrieve a range of addresses based on the subnet mask.*

## Lab №2 task:
*Socket API. Program for exchanging text messages and (or) binary files between two or more computerized using a software interface. (You cannot use WebSocket!).*
## Recommendations:
* *IP and port is not “hardcode”. We provide the ability to enter.*
* *When creating juice on the server side, you need to check the availability of the selected port (perhaps it is already in use). I will check with protection.*

## Lab №3 task:
*Create a service that implements remote file storage using the HTTP REST protocol. Support HTTP methods with the following semantics: GET - file reading, PUT - file overwriting, POST - adding to the end of the file, DELETE - deleting the file, COPY - copying the file, MOVE - moving the file. Create a client program demonstrating how the service works.*
