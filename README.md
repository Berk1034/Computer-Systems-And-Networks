Serious Labs

## Lab â„–1 task:
*Create a program that scans the local network and display information about the nodes in it. For each node, the program must display the MAC address and name. The program should also display the MAC address and the name of its own computer where the program is running.*
## Recommendations:
* *To provide for work in a situation when several network interfaces are active and the computer is connected to several networks simultaneously.*
* *If the search for addresses of the local network is performed, then retrieve a range of addresses based on the subnet mask.*
